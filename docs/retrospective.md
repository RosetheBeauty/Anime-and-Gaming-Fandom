# Project 03 Retrospective

## What Went Well
During the Project 03 proposal process, I was able to clearly organize my ideas and plan the overall structure of my project. I decided to change the activity from trivia questions to fun facts, which allowed the answers to be displayed directly on the screen. This made the content easier to follow and more visually engaging. I successfully researched images and information for the anime and gaming sections, organized them into categories, and kept the layout consistent. Overall, I felt confident in applying my software and problem-solving skills to create a cohesive proposal.

## What Went Wrong
I encountered challenges while gathering images and details for the fun facts. I made sure not to select anime or games I was actively watching or playing to avoid spoilers, which limited my options and slowed down the research process. Estimating time was also a bit tricky; formatting, layout, and ensuring the fun facts were clear and accurate took longer than I initially expected. These obstacles showed me that even with a solid plan, unexpected issues can arise during the proposal process.

## What I Would Do Differently
Next time, I would create a more detailed timeline with priorities for each proposal task to prevent spending too much time on smaller details. I would plan the fun facts or similar activities earlier so that collecting images and research is more efficient. I would also continue to use my organization and problem-solving skills but allow more flexibility to adapt to challenges, like avoiding spoilers while maintaining clear and engaging content. This reflection reinforces the importance of planning, adaptability, and attention to detail in any project.
