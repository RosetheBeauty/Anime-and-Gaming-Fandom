## Project Name
Piper & Pixels: Anime & Gaming Fandom Hub

## Project Purpose
This project aims to construct a two-page webpage highlighting popular anime and video games, like  Dan Da Dan, One Piece, Jujutsu Kaisen, Marvel Rivals, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Animal Crossing. The website will function as a fan page, displaying a mix of short descriptions, photographs, and/or entertaining information to keep visitors interested. This project also displays fundamental HTML and CSS abilities while offering a professional, well-organized GitHub repository for presentation. 

## Description

- **Header** – Website title/logo.  
- **Featured Anime Section** – Highlights Dan Da Dan, One Piece, and Jujutsu Kaisen* with images, brief, engaging descriptions, and fun facts.  
- **Featured Games Section** – Highlights Marvel Rivals, KCD2, and Animal Crossing with images, short summaries, and fun facts.    
- **Footer** – Basic info or credits.

The website will be published on GitHub Pages, with a documentation folder containing the Project Scope Statement and other planning and reference documents. 

## Desired Results
 - A functioning HTML pages with CSS styling that organizes anime and gaming content into clear categories.
