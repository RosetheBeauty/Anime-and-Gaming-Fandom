  <!-- Fun Facts -->
<section class="fun-facts-section">
  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>One Piece:</strong> With more than 1,140 episodes and ongoing broadcasts, One Piece is one of the longest-running anime series ever.</li>
    <li><strong>Dan Da Dan:</strong> The title for Dandadan came from a whim. When asked for ideas, Tatsu's editor encouraged him to just draw whatever he liked. This approach is what led to the manga's creatively free-form, chaotic style. </li>
    <li><strong>Jujutsu Kaisen:</strong> The manga was initially a four-chapter series titled Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, which became the plot of the prequel movie, Jujutsu Kaisen 0. Its immense popularity prompted the author, Gege Akutami, to turn it into a full series.</li>
    <li><strong>Marvel Rivals:</strong> Galacta, daughter of Galactus, acts as the game's narrator and is voiced by Cassandra Lee Morris, who also voiced Morgana in Persona 5. </li>
    <li><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2:</strong> The city of Kuttenberg (modern-day Kutná Hora) is a recreation of a real, historically rich Czech city that served as a major silver mining center in the 15th century.</li>
    <li><strong>Animal Crossing:</strong> The series started as a planned RPG with combat before being changed into its current format, the original Japanese game was for the N64, and specific villains like Mr. Resetti serve as a reminder for players not to reset their game.</li>
