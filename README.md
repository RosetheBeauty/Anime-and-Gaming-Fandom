# Piper & Pixels: Anime & Gaming Hub

Welcome to **Piper & Pixels**, a fan-inspired two-page website that celebrates both anime and gaming. This project showcases a curated collection of favorite anime series and video games, featuring engaging fun facts, character highlights, and visually appealing layouts to provide an immersive experience for visitors.

## About the Project

This website project was proposed as part of my final project for class. The goal of the site is to create a clean, informative, and visually engaging hub where users can explore detailed information about selected anime and games. Each section includes high-quality images, descriptions, and fun facts that make the content interactive and interesting without spoiling ongoing series or games.

Key features of the website include:

- **Anime Section:** Highlights popular series with brief descriptions and fun facts about each show and its characters.
- **Gaming Section:** Presents notable games with summaries, fun facts, and character or hero highlights.
- **Fun Facts Section:** Engages users with interesting trivia and behind-the-scenes details displayed directly on the page.
- **Responsive Design:** A two-page layout optimized for various devices, with visually consistent styling.
- **Navigation:** Easy access between home and about pages, including links to specific sections for seamless exploration.
